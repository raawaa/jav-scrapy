# Change: Update README with Installation and Runtime Requirements

## Why
The project currently lacks a comprehensive README file. Users need clear installation instructions and runtime environment requirements to properly set up and use jav-scrapy. The current CLAUDE.md contains development guidance but doesn't serve as user-facing documentation.

## What Changes
- **ADDED**: New README.md file at project root
- **ADDED**: Installation section with global and local installation methods
- **ADDED**: Runtime environment requirements (Node.js, npm versions)
- **ADDED**: System requirements and dependencies
- **ADDED**: Quick start guide with basic usage examples
- **ADDED**: Development setup section
- **ADDED**: Configuration options overview
- **ADDED**: Architecture overview for users

## Impact
- **Affected Specs**: None (new documentation file)
- **Affected Code**: None (documentation only)
- **Users**: New users can now properly install and configure the application
- **Documentation**: Provides single source of truth for installation and setup
